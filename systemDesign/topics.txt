ðŸ”· 1. Core System Design Concepts
    Learn how to design systems that scale and handle failures gracefully.
    âœ… Topics to Learn:
        Monolith vs Microservices architecture
        Layered architecture (e.g., controller, service, repository)
        API design (REST, GraphQL, gRPC)
        Load balancing & scaling
        Stateless vs Stateful services
        Fault tolerance, retries, timeouts

ðŸ”· 2. Databases (Relational + NoSQL)
    âœ… Learn:
        PostgreSQL / MySQL: ACID, joins, indexing, schema design
        NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra): Key-value, document, column stores
        Sharding, replication, partitioning
        CAP theorem

ðŸ”· 3. Caching Strategies
    Caching is key to high-performance systems.
    âœ… Learn:
        Redis / Memcached
        In-memory vs CDN (Cloudflare, Fastly)
        Cache invalidation patterns (write-through, lazy loading)

ðŸ”· 4. Message Queues & Async Processing
    Decouple services and handle background jobs.

    âœ… Learn:
        Celery + Redis/RabbitMQ
        Kafka / SQS / PubSub (for event-driven systems)
        Retry queues, dead-letter queues

ðŸ”· 5. Networking & Communication
    Understand how services communicate.

    âœ… Learn:
        HTTP, WebSockets, gRPC
        REST vs RPC
        API Gateway vs Load Balancer
        DNS, SSL, TCP/IP basics

ðŸ”· 6. DevOps & CI/CD
Ship code fast and safely.
    âœ… Learn:
        Docker & container orchestration (Kubernetes)
        CI/CD tools: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI
        Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Ansible)
        Monitoring/logging (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack)

ðŸ”· 7. Security
    Architect secure systems.

    âœ… Learn:
            Authentication: OAuth2, JWT, SSO
            Authorization: RBAC, ABAC
            HTTPS, rate limiting, CORS
            Secure password storage (bcrypt, Argon2)    

ðŸ”· 8. Scalability & Performance
Design for growth.
    âœ… Learn:
        Horizontal vs vertical scaling
        CDN usage (for static content)
        Throttling, rate limiting
        Profiling and optimization (memory, CPU, DB)

ðŸ”· 9. Cloud Platforms
    Use services instead of reinventing the wheel.
    âœ… Focus on:
        AWS (EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, SQS, ECS)
        GCP / Azure equivalents
        Deployment models (PaaS vs IaaS)
        

ðŸ”· 10. Design Patterns & Principles
    Architect maintainable systems.

        âœ… Learn:
                SOLID principles
                Common patterns: Factory, Singleton, Observer, Strategy
                Domain-driven design (DDD)
                Event-driven architecture
