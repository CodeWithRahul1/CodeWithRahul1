'''Duck Typing'''

'''
‚úÖ Duck Typing Definition (for Interview)
Duck typing is a programming concept used in dynamically typed languages like Python, where the type or class of an object is less important than the methods and properties that the object defines. In other words, an object‚Äôs suitability for use is determined by whether it "behaves like" the expected type, rather than whether it is that type.

This concept comes from the phrase:

‚ÄúIf it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck ‚Äî then it probably is a duck.‚Äù

In Python, this allows functions and classes to operate on any object that implements the required behavior (methods/attributes), enabling flexible and polymorphic code without requiring inheritance or explicit interfaces.'''

#example

class Duck:
    def quack(self):
        print("Quack!")

class Person:
    def quack(self):
        print("I'm pretending to be a duck!")

def make_it_quack(thing):
    # Duck typing in action
    thing.quack()

duck = Duck()
person = Person()

make_it_quack(duck)   # Output: Quack!
make_it_quack(person) # Output: I'm pretending to be a duck!




'''‚úÖ What is a Mixin?
A Mixin is a special type of class used to add reusable functionality to other classes through multiple inheritance ‚Äî without being a complete class on its own.

In simpler terms:

A Mixin is a helper class that provides extra methods or behavior to another class, without becoming the base or parent class of that object‚Äôs main functionality.

Mixins are not meant to be instantiated on their own ‚Äî they are designed to be "mixed in" with other classes to extend behavior.'''


'''üßæ Summary for Interview
A Mixin is a lightweight class that provides reusable behavior and is intended to be inherited alongside other classes. It promotes code reuse and clean separation of concerns. In Django, mixins are commonly used in class-based views to add functionality like login protection, permission checks, or CRUD features.'''
